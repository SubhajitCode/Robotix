# Arduino Magnet Levitation

Source code for a magnet levitation project on the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) platform. The source is in Mathematica (the controller, computer interface) and in C (Arduino Sketch).

See [my blog post](http://mekonik.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/arduino-magnet-levitation/) for details, or a short video:
